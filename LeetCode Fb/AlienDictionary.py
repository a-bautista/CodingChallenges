'''
  Time complexity: O(C) where C is the total length of all the words in the input list, added together. O(V+E) is the time for the adjacency lists.
  Space complexity: We have O(V+E) where V is the number of unique letters and E is the number of relationships. The number of vertices is U (or the number
  of unique letters). The number of edges in the worst case is min(U**2, N), so the space complexity is O(U+min(U**2, N)) but U is fixed to 26 letters, 
  so this will be O(min(26**2,N)) = O(26) = O(1).

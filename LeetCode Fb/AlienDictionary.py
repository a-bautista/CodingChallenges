'''

There is a new alien language which uses the latin alphabet. However, the order among letters are unknown to you. You receive a list of non-empty words from the dictionary, where words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language. Derive the order of letters in this language.

Example 1:

Input:
[
  "wrt",
  "wrf",
  "er",
  "ett",
  "rftt"
]

Output: "wertf"

Example 2:

Input:
[
  "z",
  "x"
]

Output: "zx"

Example 3:

Input:
[
  "z",
  "x",
  "z"
]

Output: ""

Explanation: The order is invalid, so return "".

  Time complexity: O(V+N). The original time is O(V+E) where V is the number of different characters and E is the total number of the rules in the
  language. At most, each pair of words can give us one rule, we can conclude the upper bound for the rules is O(N) where N is the number of words in the
  input, thus, time complexity is O(V+N). 
  
  Space complexity: We have O(V+N) .

'''
  Time complexity: O(V+N). The original time is O(V+E) where V is the number of different characters and E is the total number of the rules in the
  language. At most, each pair of words can give us one rule, we can conclude the upper bound for the rules is O(N) where N is the number of words in the
  input, thus, time complexity is O(V+N). 
  
  Space complexity: We have O(V+N) .

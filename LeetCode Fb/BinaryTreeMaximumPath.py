    Path with Maximum Sum (hard) #

    Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree.
    Write a function that returns the maximum sum.
    A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily
    pass through the root.


    Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
     -10
    /   \
   9     20
        /  \
      15    7


    We need to get the max values of the child nodes but this is through the roots, and these are excluded.

    We need to get the max sum in a path of the tree.

'''

A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of n nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of [val, random_index] where:

    val: an integer representing Node.val
    random_index: the index of the node (range from 0 to n-1) where random pointer points to, or null if it does not point to any node.

Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]

Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]

Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]

Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.

            # Inserting the cloned node just next to the original node.
            # If A->B->C is the original linked list,
            # Linked list after weaving cloned nodes would be A->A'->B->B'->C->C'
            # Now link the random pointers of the new nodes created.
            # Iterate the newly created list and use the original nodes random pointers,
            # to assign references to random pointers for cloned nodes.
            # Unweave the linked list to get back the original linked list and the cloned list.
            # i.e. A->A'->B->B'->C->C' would be broken to A->B->C and A'->B'->C'

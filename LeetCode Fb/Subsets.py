'''
Given a set of distinct integers, nums, return all possible subsets (the power set).

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

Example:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output:
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]

            # if the combination is done
            if len(curr) == k:
                output.append(curr[:])
            for i in range(first, n):
                # add nums[i] into the current combination
                curr.append(nums[i])
                # use next integers to complete the combination
                backtrack(i + 1, curr)
                # backtrack
                curr.pop()

        output = []
        n = len(nums)
        for k in range(n + 1):
            backtrack()
        return output

    Time complexity: O(N*2**N) to generate all subsets and then copy them into output list.

    Space complexity: O(N*2**N) to keep all the subsets of length NNN, since each of NNN elements could be present or absent.

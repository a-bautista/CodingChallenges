    Inserting a node in a Trie:
        Every character of input key is inserted as an individual trie node, i.e.,

            N = number of keys (Tree and Trie = 2 words)
            k = is the length of the keys (Tree = 4 characters and Trie = 4 characters)

            Trie and Tree represented

            root
             |
            'T'
             |
            'r'     for node r, we have 2 children
             |  \
            'i' 'e'
             |   \
            'e'  'e' -> leaf nodes

        If the input key is new or an extension of existing key, we need to construct non-existing nodes of the key, and
        mark leaf node.

        The children is an array of pointers to next level trie nodes.

        Time complexity:
            insert 	O(k) where k is the length of the key.
            lookup 	O(k)

        Space complexity:
            N = number of keys (Tree and Trie = 2 words)
            k = is the length of the keys (Tree = 4 characters and Trie = 4 characters)
            O(nâˆ—k)

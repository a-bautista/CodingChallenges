HashMap or HashTable is a type of data structure that maps keys to its value pairs.
HashTables are represented by dictionaries in Python.
Counter is a sub-class which is used to count hashable objects. It implicitly creates a hash table of an iterable when invoked.


 A set is like a hash map except it only stores keys, without values.

Sets often come up when we're tracking groups of itemsâ€”nodes we've visited in a graph,
characters we've seen in a string, or colors used by neighboring nodes. Usually, we're interested in whether something is in a set or not.


Time complexity:
    insert 	Best O(1)  Worst O(N)
    lookup 	Best O(1)  Worst O(N)
    delete 	Best O(1)  Worst O(N)

Space complexity:
 	O(n)

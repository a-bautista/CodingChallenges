When you want to find a linear order of elements that have dependencies on each other, that is, elements A, B and C are airports and in order
to go from A to C you must stop at point B, thus we say C depends on B which depends on A.

Directed graph: A graph with unidirectional edges such that its edges (U,V) are aimed one after another ( U -> V ).
